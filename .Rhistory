Affirmative asylum cases are yet to begin the deportation process in the courts.
Defensive asylum cases begin after affirmative asylum cases are denied, and take place in an immigration court.

following a surge of affirmative asylum cases, defensive asylum cases will rise, usually in the year following the affirmative asylum rise.
This data also reflects major events in history, for example, the earthquake in Haiti back in 2010,
the data shows a rise in affirmative cases and no rise in defensive asylum cases during this time.
The data gives insight into what countries may be experiencing,
as well as which countries people the US is willing to grant asylum to in any given year.")
