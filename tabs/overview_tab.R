    the United States in order to bring awareness to real data during a time 
    in our country where harmful rhetoric is often tossed around without 
    prior fact checking. Our hope is that this site sheds light on how 
    immigration, in the form of refugee arrivals, changed over time during 
    the Obama administration."),

    the Refugee Processing Center websites. These sites collected raw

    Department of State."),

    changed or stayed the same in that time?"),
